## Technologies used

## Lessons Learned
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project was a good intro to using Javascript to create different HTML elements. I used Javascript's create element function to create the next set of player inputs whenever necessary. In retrospect it would have been easier to create all the elements in HMTL and hide them with css, then Javascript could just turn off the hidden CSS classes.

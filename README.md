# Rock-Paper-Scissors in your browser!

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to make a fun interactive browser of Rock-Paper-Scissors using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project is part of the Odin Project's Javascript Fundamentals course.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Lessons Learned
This project was a good intro to using Javascript to create different HTML elements. I used Javascript's create element function to create the next set of player inputs whenever necessary. In retrospect it would have been easier to create all the elements in HMTL and hide them with css, then Javascript could just turn off the hidden CSS classes.
